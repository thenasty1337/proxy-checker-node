## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nasty1337/proxy-checker-node.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd proxy-checker-node

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Create a `proxies.txt` file in the project root with your proxies in the format:
```
username:password@host:port
```

2. Run the proxy checker:
```bash
npm start
```

The tool will:
- Check all proxies concurrently
- Display real-time progress
- Show statistics about working/non-working proxies
- Save results to JSON files

## Output Files

- `working_proxies.json`: Contains all working proxies with response times and location data
- `not_working_proxies.json`: Contains failed proxies with error messages

## Configuration

Edit the `CONFIG` object in `main.js` to customize:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    CONCURRENT_CHECKS: 100,    // Number of concurrent checks
    TIMEOUT_MS: 10000,        // Timeout for each check
    RETRY_ATTEMPTS: 2,        // Number of retry attempts
    RETRY_DELAY_MS: 1000,     // Delay between retries
    // ... other options
};
```

## Development

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Run lint and tests together
npm run check
```
